This script compiles the following information and sends it to a webhook:
- Player's username, display name, and profile URL
- Player's user ID
- Player's input device
- Player's apporoximate server region
- Player's ping rounded to five digits
- Game name and URL

This script is ready to use in Roblox Studio as a respective Server and Local script after changing the webhook URL and adding your API key. You **must** use a [webhook proxy](https://webhook.newstargeted.com/) if using Discord webhooks as Discord blocks all requests from Roblox.
